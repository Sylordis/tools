# tools

Hello, this is a private repo for tools developed through time. Help yourselves.

## What's in there

### Python modules

Each module should contain an example file showcasing how it is supposed to be used.

Examples
: The example files can be launched using `python -m <module>` from the `src` directory.
Unit tests
: Some exist. Runnable with `pytest` at the root directory of the python modules.

#### Data generation

A small python series of classes to be able to generate data if online generators are not sufficient.

#### Plot layout

A set of classes used as a wrapper around [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in order to create big layouts of plots with subplots in an easier fashion.

## Help

Each file should have its own documentation and some man pages are being created (when time allows).
